**Benito**

Last Week's Goals:

- Clean up the sound of the character's voices by either...
  - Playing their sound effects at a fixed rate that is unrelated to the speed of the text appearing
    on screen OR
  - Adjusting each sound effect / finding better sounds for each character that can be played as
    seamlessly as the bubble pop sound, while still giving the same amount of personality to each
    character (I like the first option more)
- Begin adding sound effects for interacting with different UI components such as the notebook and
  the anxiety mechanics.
- Assist other team members with producing their pieces of the game if possible.

This week:

1. Progress and issues:

- Cleaned up the sound of character's voices with a mix of both options from last week. I found that
  playing the voice sfx after every 5 letters worked quite well.
- Chose better sounds and tweaked exisitng voices for many of the characters including the Bassist,
  the Guide.
- Added voice sfx for the remainaing characters: Keebs (the Keyboardist), The Boss, and Donna
  (The guitarist).
- After our team connected the new game button to chapter 1, we noticed that the music wasn't
  playing for each chapter. At the time of writing this I've fixed this issue on the branch
  "fix-audio-on-new-game". This branch will soon be merged to main after a Code Review by our team
  (Yay, working music!).

Next Week's Goals:

- Finish setting up UI sound effects, particularly for the settings and journal buttons.
- Begin implementing Chapters 9 and 10. I'll need help to implement the conversation failure states.
- Help other team members in any way possible to reach the final product!
