**Benito**

Last Week's Goals:

- Create a dynamic dialogue sound effect system to play a different sound depending on who is talking
- Begin making different character's dialogue sounds starting with these characters.
  - Drummer voice
  - Player voice
  - Player thoughts
  - Narrator text

This week:

1. Progress and issues:

- Made the dialogue system to play a character's voice sound effect whenever that character is
  speaking.
- I struggled for a while trying to figure out what was causing the distortion on the voice sound
  effects. Eventually I found out that it was due to me setting the character's initial pitch to 0
  when it should have been set to 1 by default.
- Began creating each character's unique voice sound effect. Here are the voices I have so far...
  - Monologue: Typewriter key sound
  - Player (You): Classic bubble sound
  - Guide: Bonk sound (I will change this!!)
  - Dummer: Taiko drum sound
  - Bassist: Fax machine snippet sound
- Currently the character voices sound very bad because of how fast the dialogue appears on the
  screen causing each sound effect to fire very quickly. For very short and soft sounds like the
  bubble pop this is no big deal, but for more nuanced sounds like the taiko drum it comes out
  sloppy.

Next Week's Goals:

- Clean up the sound of the character's voices by either...
  - Playing their sound effects at a fixed rate that is unrelated to the speed of the text appearing
    on screen OR
  - Adjusting each sound effect / finding better sounds for each character that can be played as
    seamlessly as the bubble pop sound, while still giving the same amount of personality to each
    character (I like the first option more)
- Begin adding sound effects for interacting with different UI components such as the notebook and
  the anxiety mechanics.
- Assist other team members with producing their pieces of the game if possible.
