I. Team report
1. Last Week's Goals:
    (an exact copy of the third section from last week)
    - 

2. Progress and issues: 
    - what you did?
    - what worked?
    - what you learned?
    - where you had trouble? 
    - where you are stuck?

  3. Next Week's Goals:
    (Each bullet point should include a *measurable* task and
    a time estimate.  You may use nested bullet points for parts of a larger
    task.  No bottom-level time estimate should be greater than 3 days.  If a
    task would be larger, think about a logical way to break it down and to
    have insight into progress.)
