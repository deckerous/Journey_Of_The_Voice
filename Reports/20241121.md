II. Contributions of individual team members.
James
Last Week's Goals:

- Complete chapter 3 dialogue, ensure it triggers anxiety affects, triggers with mini game, triggers sprites.

Progress and issues:

- I made progress towards animating characters (implemented bones2d for Guy), completed chapter outlines, working on json and executables within dialogue jsons.
- Structuring sprites into individual elements using a different art tool allowed for better connections between bone nodes.
- I learned how to implement a skeleton inside of Godot.
- It has been challenging to linearize dialogue and monologues to allow for better parsing into individual jsons.
- I am not stuck at this time.

Next Week's Goals:

- Complete json versions of chapter scripts
  - Chapter 4 json (1/2 day)
  - Chapter 5 json (1/2 day)
  - Chapter 6 json (1/2 day)
  - Chapter 7 json (1/2 day)
  - Chapter 8 json (1/2 day)

Tracy
Last Week's Goals

- create background scenes + begin coloring

Progress/issues

- created bar and started bedroom
- didn't begin coloring; will need to investigate the layering with a pre-colored PNG for the existing character sprites

Next week's goals

- finish bedroom lineart (1/2 day)
- remaining character lineart (1 day)
- potentially begin coloring - may be later task (1/2 - 1 day)
- more involvement with programming / coding, specifically animation + streamlining (1 day)

Martin
Last Week's Goals:

- Build out tutorial screen for Box Breathing minigame

Progress and issues:

- Reworked settings page of notebook and global audio to allow separate audio busses for music and sfx
- Reviewed completed chapter to learn how to implement new chapters
- Discovered and resolved issue where the split volume sliders were not properly updating their respective level displays
- Learned more about the audio system
- Duplicating elements when creating the master volume slider caused an issue where sliders were updating the wrong text... in the future, I will make each element by hand to avoid this issue.
- The volume level signals in godot, although they looked right, didn't connect properly, and were causing the wrong level text to update. Even with code review, we were unable to find the cause of this, and I wound up just redoing the work to fix it.

Next Week's Goals:

- Split out settings to a separate menu (1 day)
  - Create a new menu background image and build a scene for the menu (1/2 day)
  - Move settings from notebook to menu scene (1/2 day)
- Build out notebook subsections to allow progression in note display (1 day)
  - Build a notebook update routine to update text fields to reflect current game state (1/2 day)
  - Work with Josh to specify how state is stored in save file and game state (1/2 day)
- Build pause/notebook menu icons for display in chapters (1/2 day)

Josh
Last Week's Goals:

- Stitch together everyone’s individual work to be combined for the beta demo.
- Start work on issues created during peer review

This week:
Progress and issues:

- Worked on refactoring tech debt code, implementing Martin’s UI, addressed issues from peer review feedback, and started fleshing out the save system.
- Refactoring code and implementing Martin’s UI went smoothly.
- Still need the player to be able to transition between the various game states like from the chapter back to the main menu.
- Working on fleshing out the save system required touching code written by other teammates and lack of documentation slowed me down in my integration.
- Currently on track to finish the save integration and UI integration but the minor remaining issues are still something we need to work on fixing.

Next Week's Goals:

- Save file handling and listing in the main menu. Time estimate: 1 day
- Help with work on an anxiety effect and coping mechanism. Time estimate: 3 days
- Address the remaining issues in the repository. Time estimate: 1 day

Matthew
Last Week's Goals:

- Finish audio system for beta

This week:

1. Progress and issues:

- Worked with people to PR new additions to code
- PRs went smoothly and main didn't explode
- Learned more about how about parts that I haven't developed worked
- Need to allot more time towards development for rest of the week

Next Week's Goals:

- Implement all remaining anxiety effects
  - Self-Talk (1 day)
  - eye contact (1 day)
  - active listening (1 day)
- Help with additional work on issues as needed

Benito
Last Week's Goals:

- Clean up character dialogue sound effect
- Implement a song to play during box-breathing

This week:

1. Progress and issues:

- Adjust the audio transition speeds between scenes
- Improve the box-breathing song using FL-studio
- Adjusting the audio transitioning speeds went well with a little help from Matthew and Josh to use the GlobalAudio script that Matthew made.
- Using FL Studio was challenging at first but I'm beginning to get the hang of it.
- More time is required to implement the updates song in the game.

Next Week's Goals:

- Create a dynamic dialogue sound effect system to play a different sound depending on who is talking
- Begin making different character's dialogue sounds starting with these characters.
  - Drummer voice
  - Player voice
  - Player thoughts
  - Narrator text
